This is hard fork/clone of https://github.com/fgbs/unifi/commit/df264dbb038bfcbaad031c41ddb2efc4f57ddc38

I used the original as a base and have added functionality as i have needed it for my work @ Touchpoint.io

The base was open, and so this shall remain open. Everything that i add has been for me as needed for my work. Nothing beyond that.

Almost all  the additional functionality came from a lot of time in chrome inspector and use of this delightful `curl -> requestslib` tool:
https://curl.trillworks.com/

As such, my notes and implementation might not be 100% correct. What you see is what get. It worked for me, and might work for you.

So everything you'll read below about "as is" stands!
